The purpose of this PHP-Script is simply accessing a database, which contains recipe information
for reading purposes only in order to display them in a web browser. The accessed database must
be in the design given by the Anymeal (http://www.wedesoft.demon.co.uk/anymeal-api/) application.
This application will propably also be used for adding and modifying content in the database as
this web frontend is not capable of supporting this.
